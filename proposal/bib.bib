abstract = {Mental workload is one of the most important constructs of interests for Human Factors researchers. Adequately assessing the amount of mental workload that people experience while performing tasks under specific conditions is essential for the design of safe and efficient systems. Due to its ease of use, the NASA TLX has become the most widely used method of measuring mental workload. However, its psychometric properties are still questionable. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent of measurement invariance of the TLX and raise awareness in the Human Factors community. Two hundred participants reported the amount of mental workload they typically experience while driving in urban and rural areas and across the country. Results indicated that the TLX lacked scalar invariance, thereby biasing the estimation of mean scores and making the examination of mean differences misleading. These findings suggest that researchers should first examine the extent of measurement invariance of the TLX before they proceed to make inferences about mean differences in the amount of mental workload reported by participants under different conditions.},

@article{Crosby1979,
abstract = {Two experiments compared the performances of male instructor pilots (IPs) and male student pilots (SPs) in a dual task paradigm combining a ground controlled approach as the primary task and memory search as the subsidiary task (ST). In Exp I, with 11 IPs and 11 SPs, the difference in ST performance between single and dual conditions was greater for SPs in the middle phase of T-37B training than for a group of experienced IPs. In Exp II, 11 SPs who had just completed T-37B training were run in the same task to determine the sensitivity of the dual task to less disparate amounts of flying experience. The difference in memory search performance between single and dual conditions for the late-phase SPs was quite similar to that of the IPs and was significantly less than that of midphase SPs. That dual task performance discriminated between student groups differing in only 4 wks of training suggests that the dual task paradigm may be of value in providing an objective measure of flight proficiency.

abstract = {Assembly and maintenance of the International Space Station (ISS) relies heavily on the use of extravehicular robotic systems. When fully assembled the ISS robotics complement will include three main manipulators, two small dexterous arms, and a mobile base and transporter system. The complexity and mobility of the systems and limited opportunities for direct viewing of the Space Station's exterior makes telerobotic operations an especially challenging task. Although fundamental manipulator design, control systems, and strategies for autonomous versus manual control vary greatly between the systems, commonality in the design of workstation controls and displays is considered essential to enhance operator performance and reduce the possibility of errors. Principal human factors opportunities are associated with workstation layout, human-computer interface considerations, adequacy of alignment cues for maintenance of safe approach corridors during mating tasks, spatial awareness challenges, integration of supplemental computer graphic displays to enhance operator global situational awareness, and training methodologies for preservation of critical skills during long-duration missions.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether concurrent bandwidth feedback improves learn-ing of the lane-keeping task in a driving simulator. Background: Previous research suggests that band-width feedback improves learning and that off-target feedback is superior to on-target feedback. This study aimed to extend these findings for the lane-keeping task. Method: Participants without a driver's license drove five 8-min lane-keeping sessions in a driver training simu-lator: three practice sessions, an immediate retention session, and a delayed retention session 1 day later. There were four experimental groups (n = 15 per group): (a) on-target, receiving seat vibrations when the center of the car was within 0.5 m of the lane center; (b) off-target, receiving seat vibrations when the center of the car was more than 0.5 m away from the lane center; (c) control, receiving no vibrations; and (d) realistic, receiving seat vibrations depending on engine speed. During retention, all groups were provided with the realistic vibrations. Results: During practice, on-target and off-target groups had better lane-keeping performance than the nonaugmented groups, but this difference diminished in the retention phase. Furthermore, during late prac-tice and retention, the off-target group outperformed the on-target group. The off-target group had a higher rate of steering reversal and higher steering entropy than the nonaugmented groups, whereas no clear group dif-ferences were found regarding mean speed, mental work-load, or self-reported measures. Conclusion: Off-target feedback is superior to on-target feedback for learning the lane-keeping task. Application: This research provides knowledge to researchers and designers of training systems about the value of feedback in simulator-based training of vehicular control.},

abstract = {Situation awareness (SA) can generally be defined as the pilot's mental model of the world around him. The ability of the pilot to maintain situation awareness has been recognized in the pilot community as crucial to mission success and survivability. Little empirical work has been done to explore this construct, however, as measurement techniques have been lacking. The Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) was developed and validated as an objective measure of a pilot's situation awareness to meet this need. An investigation of the relationship between situation awareness and performance was conducted using SAGAT. The study evaluated the utility of situation awareness in a manned fighter sweep tactical mission using experienced pilot subjects. A total of 90 trials were conducted. The results support the importance of situation awareness for mission effectiveness. Blue Team subjects were almost twice as likely to later kill an aircraft when they had SA of that aircraft, as measured by SA...},

Situation awareness is presented as a predominant concern in system operation, based on a descriptive view of decision making. The relationship between situation awareness and numerous individual and environmental factors is explored. Among these factors, attention and working memory are presented as critical factors limiting operators from acquiring and interpreting information from the environment to form situ- ation awareness, and mental models and goal-directed behavior are hypothesized as important mechanisms for overcoming these limits. The impact of design features, workload, stress, system complexity, and automation on operator situation awareness is addressed, and a taxonomy of errors in situation awareness is introduced, based on the model presented. The model is used to generate design implications for enhancing operator situation awareness and future directions for situation awareness research.},

abstract = {In a visual simple reaction time paradigm with attention divided between the left and right visual fields, re- dundancy gain refers to the finding of faster responses to stimuli presented in both fields than to single stimuli. The present study investigated whether the effects of low-level perceptual processing affect the redundancy gain by comparing the detection of onsets versus offsets. In different blocks, participants responded to left and right visual field stimuli that either appeared (onset) or disappeared (offset), with a single stimulus change in some trials and two redundant stimulus changes in others. With onset stimuli, the results replicated previous redun- dancy gain effects. In contrast, there was much less redundancy gain when participants responded to stimulus offsets. This finding suggests that redundancy gain is sensitive to low-level perceptual characteristics, such as onset versus offset presentation of stimuli},

Reflecting a wider range and scope, the second edition, newly named Human Performance, Workload, and Situational Awareness Measures Handbook, presents changes in the field and increased applications. It covers the basics of measurement and provides authoritative summaries of over 100 performance, workload, and situational awareness (SA) measures. It contains evaluations of metrics drawn from an extensive literature review and from hundreds of actual projects, grounding research with real-world applicability. The book also defines workload; provides performance, subjective, simulation, and psychological measures; and gives guidance on how to select the right workload measure. The author rounds out the coverage by presenting four types of measures for SA: subjective, observational, physiological, and measures of SA ability. What's New Additional measures of team performance Expanded glossary includes terms added to the discipline over the last 7 years Updated information from various journals including Ergonomics and Aviation, Space, and Environmental MedicineThe second edition of a tried-and-true resource, this handbook offers an overview of measurement issues and information on descriptions, strengths and limitations, and data requirements, as well as references for various measures. The original has proven invaluable to the field, and the new edition does the same by providing the tools required to develop, evaluate, and select systems for optimum performance, workload, and SA.},

abstract = {Aircraft and spacecraft pilots frequently change their level of supervisory control between full autopilot and other modes, providing varying levels of manual control. Therefore, multimodal systems must transition “gracefully,” meaning without unsafe decreases in flight performance or unacceptable changes in workload or situation awareness. Thirteen subjects flew a fixed base simulation of the NASA Constellation Program Altair lunar lander that transitioned from full autopilot to one of three flight-director-guided rate-command attitude hold manual control modes. After training, each subject flew 24 approaches, half of which included a landing point redesignation at the time of the mode transition requiring the pilot to null additional guidance errors. Bedford subjective workload and two-choice embedded secondary task response times were used to quantify temporal changes in mental workload. Situation awareness transients were detected by analysis of a tertiary task, verbal callouts of altitude, fuel, and terrain hazards. Graceful transitions were particularly difficult because Altair's large inertia made the plant dynamics relatively sluggish. Transitions to manual control increased subjective and objective workloads and decreased callout accuracy in proportion to the number of flight control axes being manually commanded.},

Subjective evaluations of 10 workload-related factors were obtained from 16 different experiments. The experimental tasks included simple cognitive and manual control tasks, complex laboratory and supervisory control tasks, and aircraft simulation. Task-, behavior-, and subject-related correlates of subjective workload experiences varied as a function of difficulty manipulations within experiments, different sources of workload between experiments, and individual differences in workload definition. A multi-dimensional rating scale is proposed in which information about the magnitude and sources of six workload-related factors are combined to derive a sensitive and reliable estimate of workload. ?? 1988.},

@phdthesis{Johnson2015,
abstract = {Modern complex aerospace systems employ flight deck automation to increase the efficiency and safety of systems while reducing operator workload. However, too much automation can lead to overtrust, complacency, and a decrease in operator situation awareness. In an attempt to prevent these from occurring, the operator and the automation often share responsibility for performing tasks. The tasks allocated to each agent are rarely fixed; instead, they can be dynamically re-allocated throughout operations based on the state of the operators, system, and environment. This thesis investigates how dynamic task re-allocation has been implemented in operational aerospace systems, and investigates the effect of control mode transitions on operator flying performance, visual attention, mental workload, and situation awareness through experimentation and simulation. This thesis reviews the dynamic task allocation literature and discusses the ways in which the concept can be implemented. It highlights adaptive automation, in which the dynamic re-allocation of tasks is initiated by the automation in a manner that is adaptive - in response to the state of the operator, system, and environment - and workload-balancing - with the purpose of keeping the operator in control as much as possible while remaining at a moderate level of mental workload. Adaptive automation is enthusiastically supported in the literature; however, for reasons discussed, it has not been deployed in any operational civilian aerospace system. In the experiment, twelve subjects sat at a fixed-base lunar landing simulator and initiated transitions between automatic and two manual control modes. Visual fixations were recorded with an eye tracker, and subjects' mental workload and situation awareness were measured using the responses to a secondary two-choice response task and a tertiary task of verbal call-outs of the vehicle state, respectively. Subjects were found to re-allocate attention according to the priority of tasks: during mode transitions from autopilot to two-axis manual control the percent of total attention on the attitude indicator (which was required for the primary flying task) increased 14{\%} while attention on instruments required for the secondary and tertiary tasks decreased 5{\%}. Subjects' conception of task priority appeared to be influenced by instructions given during training and top-down and bottom-up properties of the tasks and instrument displays. The attention allocation was also affected by the frequency of control inputs required. The percent of attention on the attitude indicator decreased up to 13{\%} across mode transitions where the flying task was not re-allocated because the pitch guidance rate-of-change decreased from -9 to 0 °/s throughout the trial. Consequently, fewer control inputs and less attention were necessary later in the trial. An integrated human-vehicle model was developed to simulate how operators allocate attention in the lunar landing task and the effect this has on flying performance, mental workload, and situation awareness. The human performance model describes how operators make estimates of the system states, correct these estimates by attending and perceiving information from the displays, and use these estimates to control the vehicle. A new attention parameter - the uncertainty in operators' estimates of system states between visual fixations - was developed that directly relates attention and situation awareness. The model's attention block was validated against experimental data, demonstrating an average difference in the percent of attention ≤3.6{\%} for all instruments. The model's predictions of flying performance, mental workload, and situation awareness were also qualitatively compared to experimental data.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.While operating a vehicle, well trained operators already know how to y, but their performance can still be improved with the assistance of an expert providing feedback in real-time. Rather than focusing on the final results of a mission, real-time operator monitoring can produce an assessment of an operator's state and task performance. This, in turn, provides important context for interpreting the operator's actions and is critical for presenting timely and relevant feedback to the operator. We designed an automated ight instructor to provide real-time feedback to a human operator during a simulated Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER) ight task. SAFER is a small propulsive jet pack worn during spacewalks for self-rescue.1 We investigate the effect of three variations of an instructor-model performance-feedback strategy on human performance in a novel SAFER inspection task. Real-time feedback was found to have a statistically significant effect of improving subject performance and decreasing workload in this complicated four degree of freedom manual control task with two secondary tasks. Subjects had to maintain both their distance from the solar array and their relative roll angle to the solar array. Significant effects were seen between the control group and the subjects exposed to real- time feedback for both the mean absolute distance error (F = 6:292, df = 2, p = 0:005) and mean absolute roll error (F = 8:348, df = 2, p = 0:001), suggesting that the use of real-time feedback improved performance.},

Monoscopic perspective projection alone is usually not sufficient to represent three-dimensional spatial information. It can, however, be improved by the adjustment of perspective parameters and by geometric visual enhancements such as reference lines and a background grid. Stereoscopic display is another method of providing three-dimensional information to the human operator. Two experiments are performed with three-axis manual tracking tasks. The first experiment investigates the effects of perspective parameters on tracking performance. The second experiment investigates the effects of visual enhancements for both monoscopic and stereoscopic displays. Results indicate that, though stereoscopic displays do generally permit superior tracking performance, monoscopic displays can allow equivalent performance when they are defined with optimal perspective parameters and provided with adequate visual enhancements.},

Manipulators will also be used to support experiments, extra-vehicular activity (EVA) and scientific activities onboard the ISS. The Canadian, Japanese and European Space Agencies are developing and delivering ‘robotic arms', each with a specific role to play over the lifetime of the ISS. Each robotic manipulator has a unique design and task specific characteristics. The Mobile Servicing System (MSS) is Canada's contribution to the ISS. It includes the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), the Mobile Base System (MBS) and the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM). The SSRMS is a 16.9 meter, 7 degree of freedom (DOF) manipulator with a relocatable base. It was launched successfully in April 2001 and within a year and a half, has installed the Airlock Quest, the MBS, and the first two truss segments (S0 and S1). SSRMS was designed to play a key role in the construction of the ISS. Canada's next robotic contribution to the ISS is a smaller, more dexterous two armed robot, the SPDM. It is scheduled for launch in Jan 2005. The Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS) is one of the National Space Development Agency of Japan's (NASDA) contributions to the ISS. The Main Arm (MA), a 9.91meter, 6 DOF manipulator, will be permanently attached to the JEM Pressurized Module (PM). More dexterous tasks will be accomplished using NASDA's Small Fine Arm (SFA), also a 6 DOF manipulator which can be operated when grappled at the end of the MA. JEMRMS will be used to support experiments being conducted on the JEM Exposed Facility (EF) and to support JEM maintenance tasks. JEMRMS is currently scheduled to be launched in June 2006. The European Robotic Arm (ERA) is an 11-meter, 7 DOF manipulator with a relocatable base intended for installing solar panels on the Russian Solar Power Platform (SPP), handling payloads and carrying out maintenance tasks. Unique to this manipulator is ERA's ability to be operated by a crewmember from either inside or outside the ISS. ERA is currently scheduled to be launched in 2007.},

These techniques are classified into two broad categories: (a) analytical or predictive techniques that may be applied early in system design, and{\~{}} (b) empirical or evaluative techniques that must be obtained with an operator-in-the--loop during simulator, prototype, or system evaluations. Information from the review provides practical guidance for selecting the most appropriate techniques for various system and resource characteristics. },

abstract = {We studied reach adaptation to a 30{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}} visuomotor rotation to determine whether augmented error feedback can promote faster and more complete motor learning. Four groups of healthy adults reached with their unseen arm to visual targets surrounding a central starting point. A manipulandum tracked hand motion and projected a cursor onto a display immediately above the horizontal plane of movement. For one group, deviations from the ideal movement were amplified with a gain of 2 whereas another group experienced a gain of 3.1. The third group experienced an offset equal to the average error seen in the initial perturbations, while a fourth group served as controls. Learning in the gain 2 and offset groups was nearly twice as fast as controls. Moreover, the offset group averaged more reduction in error. Such error augmentation techniques may be useful for training novel visuomotor transformations as required of robotic teleoperators or in movement rehabilitation of the neurologically impaired.},

However, discussion of the way to most effectively provide augmented feedback has been controversial. Related studies have focused primarily on simple or artificial tasks enhanced by visual feedback. Recently, technical advances have made it possible also to investigate more complex, realistic motor tasks and to implement not only visual, but also auditory, haptic, or multimodal augmented feedback. The aim of this review is to address the potential of augmented unimodal and multimodal feedback in the framework of motor learning theories. The review addresses the reasons for the different impacts of feedback strategies within or between the visual, auditory, and haptic modalities and the challenges that need to be overcome to provide appropriate feedback in these modalities, either in isolation or in combination. Accordingly, the design criteria for successful visual, auditory, haptic, and multimodal feedback are elaborated.},

abstract = {Nice review on scanning of items in working memory. Many studies have supported the serial exhaustive memory search model, but there are also some inconsistent data. Intesring is the finding that the size of negative set does not matter. However, items with stronger memory traces (e.g. high probability to be presented) give rise to shorter RTs, and this is difficult for the serial exhaustive scanning process. The slope increases if the stimulus is presented in another form than the items in memory (e.g. digits vs digit-words). Moreover, if memory items are from different categories scanning can become more efficient as if sometimes it stops when ghe relevent category has been exhausted. Impressive is that more complex objects (e.g. nonsense syllables) yield a slower scanning rate, and the rate of scanning is inversely proportional to the memory span (i.e. how many of the objects can be remembered).},

abstract = {{\&}STRACT A new method is proposed for using reaction-time (RT) measurements to study stages of information processing. It overcomes Iimitations of Donders' and more recent methods, and permits the discovery of stages, assessment of their properties, and separate testing of the additivity and stochastic inde*ndence of stage durations. The main feature of the additive-factor method is the search for non4n{\~{}}eracting effects of experimental factors on mean RT. The method is applied to several binary-classification experiments, where it leads to a fmr-stage m.odel, and to an identification experiment, where it distinguishes two stages. The sets of stages inferred fram both these and other data are shown to carry substantive implications. It is demonstrated that stage-durations may be additive without being stochastically independent, a result that is relevant to the formulation of mathematical models of RT.},

abstract = {any fields of endeavor require humans to conduct manual control tasks while viewing a perspective scene. Manual control refers to tasks in which continuous, or nearly continuous, control adjustments are required. Examples include flying an aircraft, driving a car, and riding a bicycle. Perspective scenes can arise through natural viewing of the world, simulation of a scene (as in flight simulators), or through imaging devices (such as the cameras on an unmanned aerospace vehicle). Designers frequently have some degree of control over the content and characteristics of a perspective scene; airport designers can choose runway markings, vehicle designers can influence the size and shape of windows, as well as the location of the pilot, and simulator database designers can choose scene complexity and content. Little theoretical framework exists to help designers determine the answers to questions related to perspective scene content. An empirical approach is most commonly used to determine optimum perspective scene configurations. The goal of the research effort described in this dissertation has been to provide a tool for modeling the characteristics of human operators conducting manual control tasks with perspective-scene viewing. This is done for the purpose of providing an algorithmic, as opposed to empirical, method for analyzing the effects of changing perspective scene content for closed-loop manual control tasks.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is the purpose of this article to identify and review criteria that rehabilitation technology should meet in order to offer arm-hand training to stroke patients, based on recent principles of motor learning. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE (1997-2007). RESULTS: One hundred and eighty seven scientific papers/book references were identified as being relevant. Rehabilitation approaches for upper limb training after stroke show to have shifted in the last decade from being analytical towards being focussed on environmentally contextual skill training (task-oriented training). Training programmes for enhancing motor skills use patient and goal-tailored exercise schedules and individual feedback on exercise performance. Therapist criteria for upper limb rehabilitation technology are suggested which are used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a number of current technological systems. CONCLUSION: This review shows that technology for supporting upper limb training after stroke needs to align with the evolution in rehabilitation training approaches of the last decade. A major challenge for related technological developments is to provide engaging patient-tailored task oriented arm-hand training in natural environments with patient-tailored feedback to support (re) learning of motor skills.},

abstract = {The practitioner of the analysis of variance often wants to draw as many conclusions as are reasonable about the relation of the true means for individual "treatments," and a statement by the F-test (or the z-test) that they are not all alike leaves him thoroughly unsatisfied. The problem of breaking up the treatment means into distinguishable groups has not been discussed at much length, the solutions given in the various textbooks differ and, what is more important, seem solely based on intuition. After discussing the problem on a basis combining intuition with some hard, cold facts about the distributions of certain test quantities (or "statistics") a simple and definite procedure is proposed for dividing treatments into distinguishable groups, and for determining that the treatments within some of these groups are different, although there is not enough evidence to say "which is which." The procedure is illustrated on examples.},

Structural and capacity theories of attention and time-sharing are contrasted, and the latter are then elaborated to describe the quantitative relation between resources and performance, and the representation of dual task data by the performance operating characteristic within a resource framework. Some deficiencies with a single resource (undifferentiated capacity) model of time-sharing are pointed out, and the multiple resources model is introduced. Data are presented supporting a specific model that defines resources by stages of processing codes of processing, and modalities of encoding. The following sections discuss the relation between multiple resources and operator performance strategies, and different measures of operator workload. The different implications of multiple resource theory on primary task, secondary task, and physiological and subjective measures of workload, and the relations between these are considered},

abstract = {The rationale for the use of the Sternberg memory search task as a diagnostic measure of pilot workload is described, and seven investigations that have employed this task in flight simulators or aircraft environments are summarized. The details of two further flight simulator experiments in which workload is measured by an auditory Sternberg task are reported. These results indicate the diagnostic value of the task in discriminating between the perceptual/central processing and response demands of a holding pattern and an approach pattern, respectively. Perceptual and response load were greater in an approach phase, relative to a holding phase. Neither phase imposed a substantial central processing load. Based upon the findings of the studies described, the paper concludes with a set of recommendations for employing the Sternberg task in aviation environments. These recommendations emphasize the importance of information display and response procedures, the choice of particular memory sets, the presentation of data, and the need to avoid extremely difficult flight tasks.},

abstract = {To answer the question: "what is 3D good for?" we reviewed the body of literature concerning the performance implications of stereoscopic 3D (S3D) displays versus non-stereo (2D or monoscopic) displays. We summarized results of over 160 publications describing over 180 experiments spanning 51 years of research in various fields including human factors psychology/ engineering, human-computer interaction, vision science, visualization, and medicine. Publications were included if they described at least one task with a performance-based experimental evaluation of an S3D display versus a non-stereo display under comparable viewing conditions. We classified each study according to the experimental task(s) of primary interest: (a) judgments of positions and/or distances; (b) finding, identifying, or classifying objects; (c) spatial manipulations of real or virtual objects; (d) navigation; (e) spatial understanding, memory, or recall and (f) learning, training, or planning. We found that S3D display viewing improved performance over traditional non-stereo (2D) displays in 60{\%} of the reported experiments. In 15{\%} of the experiments, S3D either showed a marginal benefit or the results were mixed or unclear. In 25{\%} of experiments, S3D displays offered no benefit over non-stereo 2D viewing (and in some rare cases, harmed performance). From this review, stereoscopic 3D displays were found to be most useful for tasks involving the manipulation of objects and for finding/identifying/classifying objects or imagery. We examine instances where S3D did not support superior task performance. We discuss the implications of our findings with regard to various fields of research concerning stereoscopic displays within the context of the investigated tasks. ?? Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Once considered too processing-intense for general utility, application of the third dimension to convey complex information is facilitated by the recent proliferation of technological advancements in computer processing, 3D displays, and 3D perspective (2.5D) renderings within a 2D medium. The profusion of complex and rapidly-changing dynamic information being conveyed in operational environments has elevated interest in possible military applications of 3D technologies. 3D can be a powerful mechanism for clearer information portrayal, facilitating rapid and accurate identification of key elements essential to mission performance and operator safety. However, implementation of 3D within legacy systems can be costly, making integration prohibitive. Therefore, identifying which tasks may benefit from 3D or 2.5D versus simple 2D visualizations is critical. Unfortunately, there is no “bible” of human factors guidelines for usability optimization of 2D, 2.5D, or 3D visualizations nor for determining which display best serves a particular application. Establishing such guidelines would provide an invaluable tool for designers and operators. Defining issues common to each will enhance design effectiveness. This paper presents the results of an extensive review of open source literature addressing 3D information displays, with particular emphasis on comparison of true 3D with 2D and 2.5D representations and their utility for military tasks. Seventy-five papers are summarized, highlighting militarily relevant applications of 3D visualizations and 2.5D perspective renderings. Based on these findings, human factors guidelines for when and how to use these visualizations, along with recommendations for further research are discussed.},
